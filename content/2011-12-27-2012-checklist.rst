Tech Checklist for 2012:
------------------------

-  **onePage**: A chrome plugin to better read html pages.[like clearly by
   evernote] [side-effect, learn chrome plugin development]
-  **oneEdit**: A lightweight online editor [side-effect, learn javascript]
-  **tweetZilla**: with continuous deployment, the natural way of tracking
   issues is to follow-up on feedback from users through tweets. parse
   the tweets, cluster by issue[use k-means clustering] and follow-up
   until they are fixed.

Life checklist:
---------------

-  *Be organized*: Need to stop missing the deadlines and schedules. Find
   a tool to organize everything.
-  *Less distraction*: At any point of time, I have 15-20 chrome tabs open
   in a window.[not to mention, multiple windows :-/]. I have an account
   in every new social/tech/recommendation/news-feed site, with far less
   interaction.
-  *Overcome Analyses-Paralysis*: Spend less time analyzing, more time
   implementing.

Personal checklist:
-------------------

-  Pause more often: Stop rushing through life.
-  Speak more: Have to stop talking to the point.[this is futile]
-  Stop binge eating: The fact that I don't put on weight even after
   destroying kilos of chocolates, doesn't mean I should abuse my
   stomach and teeth.
-  Continue not being an asshole.
