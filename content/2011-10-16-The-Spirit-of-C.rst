Enough has been said and written about dmr's contribution to the modern digital era. What's missing
though, is reiteration of the principles on which C was written. If you are one of those Java/C# and other HLL fan boys,
it will serve you well to glance over the below section.

The Spirit of C:
------------------

- Trust the programmer.
- Don't prevent the programmer from doing what needs to be done.
- Keep the language small and simple.
- Provide only one way to do an operation.
- Make it fast, even if it is not guaranteed to be portable.
