Masinagudi
----------------------------------


One of the best weekend getaways near bangalore, especially in monsoon
season.Its surrounded with lush greenery and beautiful mountain view. We
had stayed in a wonderful home stay called `Bamboo
Banks <http://bamboobanks.in/>`_ guest house. Its set in a 42 acre farm
with just around 4 cottages, each wonderful in its own way. Horse
riding, a dip in the pool and a short walk through the farm would take
up your entire day. Do stay there, if you are in masinagudi.
