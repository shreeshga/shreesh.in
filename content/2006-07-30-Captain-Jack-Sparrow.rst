Captain Jack Sparrow
----------------------------------

::

    "This is the day that you will ALWAYS remember as the day that you...
    almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow"


There,I've quoted it for the last time before it becomes a terrible
bore.Captain Jack Sparrow is quite a character, and a character he must
be to hold the Pirates... movie together, on his own.

The second part is all about Jack.Jack the Cunning,Jack the Wily,Jack
the Captain,Jack the Coward,Jack the Hero, Jack the Bi(??) and of course
Jack the Pirate.People want to see him(I am no different) and thank god
he did not disappoint. All hail Johhny Depp!

Apparently, people like Jack Sparrow,irrespective of how much ever
absurd the scene might be, Jack stands out.His character is a mix of
self contradicting qualities: cowardly brave, gay-ishly straight,
cunningly naive, seriously funny but *good* nonetheless. (Apparently
being good is vital for one to be likeable). Maybe Jack will become the
new definition of Commercial Hero. Personally I think his character was
screwed up by making him "generous" and "brave". Jack Sparrow was a born
winner and the secret was that, he wasn't your regular
baddie-bashing-Hero When he wants to save his ass, he doesn't damn who
gets hurt or killed. He can be a coward when he wants to,a loser when he
wants to or even a killer.. if he wants to. I would have loved to see
him just walk away without a glance when the Kraken attacks the ship,
instead of returning to the ship.

All the noble deeds should have been left to Mr.Turner, That at least
would have put some meat into his character.
