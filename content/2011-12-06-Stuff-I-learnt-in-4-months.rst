Its been almost a semester since I started in Cornell and without a blogpost.
Which is unacceptable. Ergo the blog-gates will open.
I love bullets, hence instead of a paragraphs, there will be bullet points.

I honestly believe  that taking a break from work and studying for a year does
wonders to your energy levels. I can now work faster, better and more eager to
work.

I dabbled for a while about continuing in research and thought for a while..

**The lure of Academia**

- Contagious enthusiasm: You are surrounded by (mostly)enthusiastic bunch.
- Work hard play hard lifestyle: No monotonicity.
- Flexible: With classes as rare as twice a week and as sparse as a sparse
  matrix, you have all the freedom to be a night owl or an early bird.
- In general the work is much more interesting.

**The lure of Corporate**

- Money

*Sigh*
