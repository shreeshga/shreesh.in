VLC
---------

So, yesterday was one of those nights where you will feel the
infiniteness of time. The keeps stretching and the work you wanted to
finish never left the dock. And so you start messing around your web
blog, create pages, delete pages, open iWeb and *delete* your wordpress
blog.

!!

Saw the time, it was 3:00am. Had been working through that time of the
night when the brain cells are tired shit and ready to drop.With a
little curse and a mild grunt, i started to put together the site
again.Lets hope, this time it sticks around for good.

On a side note: How to view video on PC in your laptop

-  ssh from your laptop to your machine, type ``vlc --sout udp:(laptop ip address)``
-  Choose a file on PC and play in VLC.
-  In your laptop, open VLC player.
``File->Open Capture  Device ->Network-> Open RTP/UDP Stream -> type your PC address -> Open``

-  Voila!
