I was looking forward to *The Android App Clinic: Travel Booking and Planning*
[link_] by Reto Meier & Ian Ni-Lewis. I even put in a little unnamed comment
and a thumbs up for KAYAK.
[Notice the lowercase 'I'].

  "i work for kayak and would love some feedback."


Although it was a good third-perspective, It had some problems:

* Too much focus on  Android UI Design guideline.
* Considering they review many many apps, seemingly common repetitive UI
patterns start to annoy them [Like the "Rate Me Rate Me!!" dialog]
* A very cursory review, overlooking the content and just focusing on the
presentation.

They followed it up with a redesign of the KAYAK [and other apps] so that its
more consistent with the Android UI pattern[design_link_].

But what struck me most, was their absolute focus on enforcing the Android UI
patterns among all the apps. Which isn't surprising since the overall Android
experience is their **Product**. And they were right in being particular about
it.

The problem is that, the companies building those apps want to promote
*their* product and want to have a consistent experience across devices.

Hence, the priorities of consumer-facing companies and device platform creators are
orthogonal.

But when I start to use the apps as normal user, I can 'decipher' most of the
UI elements and for the most part don't care if an app misses the ActionBar
pattern.

| I am obsessed with my product[my time], and until the apps don't waste it.
| I would live with a gradient header with a center text.

| PS: As an android fan, I would love to see all the apps having the same  Android UI pattern.
