On a night like this
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On a night like this, there are very few things which can go right.A
rick with a right indicator isn't one of them though.An alcohol induced
nerve cells tingling for the entire night might just be the thing.Even
otherwise its a money well spent. It made me feel happy.I can handle
driving when drunk(oh pliss), but i can't handle the randomness in my
head.Sometimes I feel as satisfied as a hippie and other times, total
weirdness. Assuming this weirdness isn't hangover, maybe this is how i
should be when I am sober.Lots o f weirdness in my head. And when i am
drunk ,there should just be peace-ness.If I have to get drunk to tickle
my nerve cells, My nerve cells must be fried beyond repair.More so the
reason to drink more and get most out of them while i still can!

Wait, how did I get to that conclusion?
