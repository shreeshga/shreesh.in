Wave nature of Life 
--------------------------------

Thought for today...

::

	Some people's lives are like cosine (x) -- starts at 1 and then goes to
	0. Other people's lives are like sine (x) -- starts at 0 and then goes
	to 1. But when you take the integral from 0 to 2 pi, it comes out to 0
	for everyone.
