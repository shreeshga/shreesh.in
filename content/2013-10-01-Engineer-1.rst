I have seen many posts which say being an early employee is not worth it. I disagree in that you can't make the experience worth your time without putting in years of work.  

When you join a company as the first non-founding employee, give it a deadline.
A soft deadline of a year, where you have something else[higher studies, other job etc] going on and you can use your current startup experience to get a better job.
Rarely anything worthwhile happens in the first year. But you will learn a valuable lesson: "Should you really be in a startup?"

Then there is a hard headline of 2 years [during which you either you have a definite plan on higher studies or another company], where either:
	1) The company will get a decent funding and you are starting to get a decent salary 
	2) The company is still stagnant and the founders are playing it safe.
	3) The founders keep saying it will take off in the next year.	

There is almost no reason for employees without founder shares to stick around if 1)is not happening.

So, enter the startup with a backup plan *always*.
