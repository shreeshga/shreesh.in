Putin on Chechen extremists, on September 24, 1999:
---------------------------------------------------

  "We'll follow terrorists everywhere. We will corner the bandits in the
  toilet and wipe them out.If you are a Christian, you are in danger. Even
  if you are an atheist, you are in danger, and if you decide to convert
  to Islam, this will not save you, either, because traditional Islam is
  inimical to the conditions and objectives set by the terrorists. If you
  are prepared to become a most radical Islamist and are prepared to
  circumcise yourself, I invite you to come to Moscow. I will recommend
  having the operation done in such a way that nothing will grow for you
  there anymore."

Putin snapping back at a reporter from Le Monde who asked a critical
question about the conduct of the war in Chechnya, in November 2002. The
quotation was rendered innocuous by his interpreter, but the original
was recorded on audio and widely reprinted in Russia.

He knows how to treat insurgents.No deal with the terrorists.Pure guts
to send troops to kill terrorists in beslan school hostage crises.no
prize for guessing what our government would have done.gift wrap a
ransom and parcel some hi-funda criminals for them and hold a victory
party.How can you negotitate with a terrorist?Only a spy knows the only
way you negotiate with a terrorist to point a gun at his and...pull the
trigger.But the question is,is he taking the aggressive stance so much
so as to kill all those who oppose him? However insignificant they might
be? First `Anna Politkovskaya(shot
dead) <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/07/AR2006100700308.html>`_
now `Litvinenko(poisoned by no less than
polonium-210). <http://www.sweetness-light.com/archive/britain-says-putin-critic-died-of-radiation-poisoning>`_
One was investigating rights violation in Chechen area by Russian forces
and the other was blaming the Russian govt of 1999 bombings in
Russia.And thats not all, 12 journalists have been killed in russia
since 2000!its the third most dangerous place on earth for journalists!

I don't think Putin would risk such high-profile killings in public just
to silence some constantly blabbering journalists(they might be right of
course!) that too when his popularity is high in Russia.

But Putin don't think has unlearned what he has learned at FSB,In his
own words...

  On December 2005, Putin said to a group of FSB officers: "There is
  no such thing as a former KGB man"
