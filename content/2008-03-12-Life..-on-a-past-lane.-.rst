Life.. on a past lane
----------------------------------


Four years since I started working, Changed one company.. No enthusiasm
to change again. [Interesting work will be done on weekends rather than
in a stuffy software company.] 
Memorable events

  -  Visited Switzerland
  -  Visited Paris.
  -  Visited Italy
  -  Visited Amsterdam
  -  Visited Singapore
  -  Made an "international good friend"
  -  Went to the Highest Accessible Point in Europe
  -  Smoked a cigarette with a Korean friend at 00:00 AM on the street at
     a freezing temperature of 0 Celsius with only a shirt and pyjama.
  -  Taught a Korean how to smoke in Indian Style
  -  Tried all the Sea Foods(Octopus,Squid,small fish,Oyster..) before I
     could digest what they were.
  -  Learnt to cook edible food
  -  Made some "friends"... lost some..
  -  Made new memories, to help fade out the old ones...


Life gave too much.. I could have survived with less :) All thanks to a
"thing" called software.
