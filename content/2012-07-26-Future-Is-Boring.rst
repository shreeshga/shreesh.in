Recently I read an article on the size_of_the_univese_ and it ends with a rather depressing line:

    Once you put our knowledge about dark matter and dark energy in there, 
    you’ll realize that we’ll never see more of the Universe than we can right now.

Well, Thats a bummer. No wonder NASA isn't getting any funding.

People should  stop making such depressing posts. Some people like me, have lived
life thinking some time in the future, we might drop a visit to the far end of the universe and have a cup of coffee with aliens. Such news need to be put in spoiler alerts.


In other news, That boson which was observed, might *might* just be the Higgs boson.
If its not the higgs boson, I want my hours of "Higg's boson goggling" back.
The only real aspiration in my life was to understand the world
we are in. Since the news of the boson, I try to imagine every thing in
terms of how the bosons might be interacting with an imaginary "field".

Piling on top of it are the observations which totally defy what I have learnt
in school. For example, unicellular organisms aren't the smallest anymore.
`There are wasps the size of an amoeba! <http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/11/30/how-fairy-wasps-cope-with-being-smaller-than-amoebas>`_.

|   Imagine the size of the cells!
|   I totally take back my admiration for Amoeba,Paramecia and such others.

|   Wait, It gets worse:

  * No more Batman movies from Nolan.
  * The never ending tirade against Facebook/Microsoft/Google/Apple.
  * App developers and *CEO n00bs*  suddenly realizing app revenue can't pay them 
    enough money for  their grand children finish medical school.

I can't wait to die [oh, and also  verify my hindu beliefs]
