			<h1>Cornell MEng CS Survival guide</h1>
			<p>Cornell is a <strong>great</strong> place to study. Having worked for quite sometime, I can
better appreciate and analyse the whole experience of academia.</p>
<p>Based on my semester worth of experience here are my two cents on surviving the
course.</p>
<div class="section" id="about-ithaca">
<h2>About Ithaca</h2>
<p>Its beautiful in summer and white as Gandalf during winters.</p>
<p><em>Collegetown</em> is a hub of activity and most certainly the place to be on a Friday
night. There are quite a few pubs, so getting drunk and studying should be
possible on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>There are beautiful parks,lakes,gorges and falls which should not be missed.
PS: The airport is no bigger than a dining hall and the planes are small bombardier aircrafts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="selecting-courses">
<h2>Selecting courses</h2>
<p>You need to complete 30 credits in two semesters.</p>
<p>There are two tracks: Systems and Machine Learning.</p>
<p>Systems courses are related to OS, Database and compilers.
Machine Learning courses deal with Machine learning algorithms, Data Analysis and Robotics.
Although you can take any courses, its best if you stick one track and pick courses in depth.</p>
<p>My advice is to add all the courses you are interested(max 22 credits) and
attend the classes for a few days. Drop the ones which don't interest you or
which seem too difficult to handle.</p>
<p>My picks for Fall:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Machine Learning : Course content is very interesting and Prof. Joachims is well known  for his work on <em>SVM</em></li>
<li>Operating Systems Practicum: You will build an entire OS complete with
scheduler,Networking and IPC.</li>
<li>Information Retrieval: Prof. Ginsparg is very famous for his work on <a class="reference external" href="http://arxiv.org">arxiv</a></li>
<li>Database Systems: The course goes in-depth into SQL queries and optimization.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="managing-course-work">
<h2>Managing course work</h2>
<p><strong>Clarify doubts about assignments and start working as soon as they are posted</strong></p>
<p>I can't stress this enough. Failure to do so will ruin you of your whatever
life you might have on your weekends.</p>
<p>Do not take more than 14 credits (for an average person). Try to pick courses
which have assigments and project work in groups rather than alone.
The examinations here stress more about application of a concept than mere
verbatim textbook content.</p>
<p>Make time on Thursdays and Saturdays and play <em>ping-pong</em> or any other sport at
Helen Newman Hall</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="placements">
<h2>Placements</h2>
<p>Cornell career center is pretty amazing in attracting all the top companies for
its career fair. Make sure you prepare for the interview by practising  dynamic
programming code, efficient sorting/searching code, algorithm complexity and
some design questions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="winter-break">
<h2>Winter break</h2>
<p>Don't stay in Ithaca between Christmas and New year. It will be a ghost town.
Make some travel plans, or better, try for some winter internships.</p>
