&lt;h2&gt;News I can use?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
A Hindi Profesor was having an illicit relation with one of his
students.Problem is that he is already married.This affair was brought
to light when the Prof wife saw both of them together.Needless to say
his wife is totally distraught and angry at his husband for cheating on
her,and on the student as well.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There You have it.Dont you feel enlightened now? You are mad if you
think that it's the most trivial news ever.And deserve to be admitted to
NIMHANS immediatly...you will find me there. If you are on the other
hand enlightened, then dont thank me! The credit goes to the &amp;quot;Sabse
Tez!&amp;quot; news channel AAJ TAK for showing this amazing new story all day
long with all the &amp;quot;josh&amp;quot; and whole lotta screaming that goes with
it.Thanks AAJ TAK! for drilling this new story all day long,scene by
scene, live at the Prof's house(who was half naked BTW),almost making it
into a soap with all the drama unfolding at his house. The description
of the event, the in depth analysis, and above all dedicating the
precious air-time of the news time to this ... silly bunch of crap made
me puke all over;again and again, Do we even care if some sorry old Prof
got all his libido revved up after 50 yrs again, enough to take it all
over some sorry woman,who is not his wife? And the way they deliver the
new s item is what makes me sick all over.Why does does the media always
take some silly news and blow it all up a if it's gonna change our
wrld?And when you deliver some news item,please just... deliver.Dont
make a drama out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because frankly, no news about someone who's not even related, is gonna
make me go down on my knees and cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
