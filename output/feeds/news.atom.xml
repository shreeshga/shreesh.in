&lt;blockquote&gt;
Times of close approach are called ”launch windows” in the spaceflight vernacular.
Even though Mars doesn’t always come close enough for clear visual observation, navigators have an opportunity to launch a spacecraft to Mars every 26 months. Spaceships don’t just take off in any direction.
Escaping Earth’s gravitational pull requires a tremendous amount of energy. Even with that energy a spacecraft would never reach the orbit of Mars without a little help from its friends. To get a spacecraft to Mars, navigators time the launch so the spacecraft reaches Mars when it is on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth in order to take advantage of solar gravity.
The Sun’s gravitational pull will cause a spacecraft to “fall” toward the Sun. This motion follows predictable physical laws. These trajectories and orbits are collectively referred to as Hohmann transfer orbits. ”What you want to do is launch the spacecraft so it goes around the Sun to meet Mars,” says Moriba Jah at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a navigator on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, We give it the least amount of energy possible and let the Sun’s gravity do as much as it can for us. As a result the spacecraft comes up on Mars from behind, but instead of sailing past, a short blast from the boosters allow it to slow down and be captured into orbit by Mars’ gravity. The trip takes about 214 days.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Once you put our knowledge about dark matter and dark energy in there,
you’ll realize that we’ll never see more of the Universe than we can right now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, Thats a bummer. No wonder NASA isn't getting any funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People should  stop making such depressing posts. Some people like me, have lived
life thinking some time in the future, we might drop a visit to the far end of the universe and have a cup of coffee with aliens. Such news need to be put in spoiler alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, That boson which was observed, might &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; just be the Higgs boson.
If its not the higgs boson, I want my hours of &amp;quot;Higg's boson goggling&amp;quot; back.
The only real aspiration in my life was to understand the world
we are in. Since the news of the boson, I try to imagine every thing in
terms of how the bosons might be interacting with an imaginary &amp;quot;field&amp;quot;.
|  Although, I &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; not to do it when I am around people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piling on top of it are the observations which totally defy what I have learnt
in school. For example, unicellular organisms aren't the smallest anymore.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/11/30/how-fairy-wasps-cope-with-being-smaller-than-amoebas"&gt;There are wasps the size of an amoeba!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Imagine the size of the cells!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I totally take back my admiration for Amoeba,Paramecia and such others.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Wait, It gets worse:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No more Batman movies from Nolan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The never ending tirade against Facebook/Microsoft/Google/Apple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App developers and &lt;em&gt;CEO n00bs&lt;/em&gt;  suddenly realizing app revenue can't pay them
enough money for  their grand children finish medical school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't wait to die [oh, and also  verify my hindu beliefs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Putin on Chechen extremists, on September 24, 1999:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;We'll follow terrorists everywhere. We will corner the bandits in the
toilet and wipe them out.If you are a Christian, you are in danger. Even
if you are an atheist, you are in danger, and if you decide to convert
to Islam, this will not save you, either, because traditional Islam is
inimical to the conditions and objectives set by the terrorists. If you
are prepared to become a most radical Islamist and are prepared to
circumcise yourself, I invite you to come to Moscow. I will recommend
having the operation done in such a way that nothing will grow for you
there anymore.&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putin snapping back at a reporter from Le Monde who asked a critical
question about the conduct of the war in Chechnya, in November 2002. The
quotation was rendered innocuous by his interpreter, but the original
was recorded on audio and widely reprinted in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He knows how to treat insurgents.No deal with the terrorists.Pure guts
to send troops to kill terrorists in beslan school hostage crises.no
prize for guessing what our government would have done.gift wrap a
ransom and parcel some hi-funda criminals for them and hold a victory
party.How can you negotitate with a terrorist?Only a spy knows the only
way you negotiate with a terrorist to point a gun at his and...pull the
trigger.But the question is,is he taking the aggressive stance so much
so as to kill all those who oppose him? However insignificant they might
be? First &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/07/AR2006100700308.html"&gt;Anna Politkovskaya(shot
dead)&lt;/a&gt;
now &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sweetness-light.com/archive/britain-says-putin-critic-died-of-radiation-poisoning"&gt;Litvinenko(poisoned by no less than
polonium-210).&lt;/a&gt;
One was investigating rights violation in Chechen area by Russian forces
and the other was blaming the Russian govt of 1999 bombings in
Russia.And thats not all, 12 journalists have been killed in russia
since 2000!its the third most dangerous place on earth for journalists!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think Putin would risk such high-profile killings in public just
to silence some constantly blabbering journalists(they might be right of
course!) that too when his popularity is high in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Putin don't think has unlearned what he has learned at FSB,In his
own words...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
On December 2005, Putin said to a group of FSB officers: _&amp;quot;There is
no such thing as a former KGB man&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
