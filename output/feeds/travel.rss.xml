&lt;h2&gt;Masinagudi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best weekend getaways near bangalore, especially in monsoon
season.Its surrounded with lush greenery and beautiful mountain view. We
had stayed in a wonderful home stay called &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bamboobanks.in/"&gt;Bamboo
Banks&lt;/a&gt; guest house. Its set in a 42 acre farm
with just around 4 cottages, each wonderful in its own way. Horse
riding, a dip in the pool and a short walk through the farm would take
up your entire day. Do stay there, if you are in masinagudi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
