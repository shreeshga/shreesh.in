&lt;h2&gt;The Shining&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000040/"&gt;Stanley Kubrick&lt;/a&gt;, known for
his compulsiveness and numerous retakes, got the difficult shot of
blood pouring from the elevators in only three takes. This would be
remarkable if it weren't for the fact that the shot took nine days
to set up; every time the doors opened and the blood poured out,
Kubrick would say, &amp;quot;It doesn't look like blood.&amp;quot; They had tried
shooting that scene for an entire year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000040/"&gt;Stanley Kubrick&lt;/a&gt; demanded
127 takes from†&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001167/"&gt;Shelley
Duvall&lt;/a&gt; in one scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to†&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000175/"&gt;Stephen King&lt;/a&gt;,
the title is inspired by the refrain in the Plastic Ono Band's song,
&amp;quot;Instant Karma&amp;quot; (by†&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006168/"&gt;John
Lennon&lt;/a&gt;), which features the
chorus: &amp;quot;We all shine on.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the scene in which Jack breaks down the bathroom door, the props
department built a door that could be easily broken. However,†&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000197/"&gt;Jack
Nicholson&lt;/a&gt; worked as a
volunteer fire marshal and tore it apart easily. The props
department were then forced to build a stronger door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steadicam operator†&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0113593/"&gt;Garrett
Brown&lt;/a&gt; accomplished many of
the ultra-low tracking corridor sequences from a wheelchair on which
his invention was mounted. Grips would either pull backward or push
forward the wheelchair, depending on the requirement of the shot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just thought i would post some trivia on my†favorite†horror movie of all
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A movie scene&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always been a fan of movies/Tv series starring Pankaj kapoor,the
earliest of which I didn't even remember the name.It was a story of
doctor,struggling to pursue his passion of finding a cure. His days
spent toiling away in his makeshift lab,amidst a strained family life
and a convoluted professional environment.I can neither recall the
plot,nor th actress nor the director.But I still vividly remember the
bearded face of the doctor with weary eyes, searching for an elusive
horizon.The strain of a man pulled in many different directions.I do
remember the scene, where his wife picks up his dairy from the table,
and reads two 2 short lines scribbled at the end of a page filled with
notes.Which summarizes the thoughts of the character:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
So much to do, So little is done&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS:The name of the movie I later found out was &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ek_Doctor_Ki_Maut"&gt;Ek Doctor ki
Maut&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Captain Jack Sparrow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
&amp;quot;This is the day that you will ALWAYS remember as the day that you...
almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There,I've quoted it for the last time before it becomes a terrible
bore.Captain Jack Sparrow is quite a character, and a character he must
be to hold the Pirates... movie together, on his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part is all about Jack.Jack the Cunning,Jack the Wily,Jack
the Captain,Jack the Coward,Jack the Hero, Jack the Bi(??) and of course
Jack the Pirate.People want to see him(I am no different) and thank god
he did not disappoint. All hail Johhny Depp!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, people like Jack Sparrow,irrespective of how much ever
absurd the scene might be, Jack stands out.His character is a mix of
self contradicting qualities: cowardly brave, gay-ishly straight,
cunningly naive, seriously funny but &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; nonetheless. (Apparently
being good is vital for one to be likeable). Maybe Jack will become the
new definition of Commercial Hero. Personally I think his character was
screwed up by making him &amp;quot;generous&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;brave&amp;quot;. Jack Sparrow was a born
winner and the secret was that, he wasn't your regular
baddie-bashing-Hero When he wants to save his ass, he doesn't damn who
gets hurt or killed. He can be a coward when he wants to,a loser when he
wants to or even a killer.. if he wants to. I would have loved to see
him just walk away without a glance when the Kraken attacks the ship,
instead of returning to the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the noble deeds should have been left to Mr.Turner, That at least
would have put some meat into his character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
