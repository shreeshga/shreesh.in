&lt;h2&gt;The art of creating wedding invitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out; I am getting married. So, I wanted to create a web site instead of
mailing everyone with a Megabytes of scanned invitation [I know, not very Indian of me].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a  programmer, using e-wedding or such other hosting sites is wholly
&lt;em&gt;unacceptable&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had worked with Python Flask before, so I quickly put together a static site
using the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mbr/flask-bootstrap"&gt;Flask-Bootstrap-Responsive&lt;/a&gt; plugin [see? How easily I  put together
a site with best of the breed] and threw it in my AWS micro instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the idea of creating a joint-timeline of Prerna &amp;amp; me, with special
moments along with some pictures. Turns out Facebook has the feature in &amp;quot;See
Friendship&amp;quot; [who knew?]. I found an awesome js library &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://timeline.verite.co/"&gt;TimelineJS&lt;/a&gt; which reads data from  published Google
spreadsheet, parses the data and displays a nice timeline of events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, We both started filling in the event details in a shared Google drive &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AtNxSwigiymodHR5ZEFnOUN0T3ZhUWJNRWEzTXFJemc&amp;amp;single=true&amp;amp;gid=0&amp;amp;output=html"&gt;Spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;.
I, for the most part, edited the sheet from the Android Google &lt;em&gt;Drive App&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to have a message board to get people to leave  a message.
[I hate the guest book feature which is essentially a text box and submit
button] Sadly, Google+ does not yet support a writable comment box plugin.
So, went with the least desirable FB comment box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unkIVvjZc9Y"&gt;HDFU&lt;/a&gt; and write your own
wedding site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://prerna.shreesh.in"&gt;Wedding!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Having worked for quite sometime, I can
better appreciate and analyse the whole experience of academia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my semester worth of experience here are my two cents on surviving the
course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="about-ithaca"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About Ithaca&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its beautiful in summer and white as Gandalf during winters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collegetown&lt;/em&gt; is a hub of activity and most certainly the place to be on a Friday
night. There are quite a few pubs, so getting drunk and studying should be
possible on a weekly basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are beautiful parks,lakes,gorges and falls which should not be missed.
PS: The airport is no bigger than a dining hall and the planes are small bombardier aircrafts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="selecting-courses"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Selecting courses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to complete 30 credits in two semesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two tracks: Systems and Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems courses are related to OS, Database and compilers.
Machine Learning courses deal with Machine learning algorithms, Data Analysis and Robotics.
Although you can take any courses, its best if you stick one track and pick courses in depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice is to add all the courses you are interested(max 22 credits) and
attend the classes for a few days. Drop the ones which don't interest you or
which seem too difficult to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My picks for Fall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine Learning : Course content is very interesting and Prof. Joachims is well known  for his work on &lt;em&gt;SVM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating Systems Practicum: You will build an entire OS complete with
scheduler,Networking and IPC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information Retrieval: Prof. Ginsparg is very famous for his work on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://arxiv.org"&gt;arxiv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database Systems: The course goes in-depth into SQL queries and optimization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="managing-course-work"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Managing course work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarify doubts about assignments and start working as soon as they are posted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't stress this enough. Failure to do so will ruin you of your whatever
life you might have on your weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not take more than 14 credits (for an average person). Try to pick courses
which have assigments and project work in groups rather than alone.
The examinations here stress more about application of a concept than mere
verbatim textbook content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make time on Thursdays and Saturdays and play &lt;em&gt;ping-pong&lt;/em&gt; or any other sport at
Helen Newman Hall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="placements"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Placements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cornell career center is pretty amazing in attracting all the top companies for
its career fair. Make sure you prepare for the interview by practising  dynamic
programming code, efficient sorting/searching code, algorithm complexity and
some design questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="winter-break"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Winter break&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't stay in Ithaca between Christmas and New year. It will be a ghost town.
Make some travel plans, or better, try for some winter internships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tech Checklist for 2012:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;onePage&lt;/strong&gt;: A chrome plugin to better read html pages.[like clearly by
evernote] [side-effect, learn chrome plugin development]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;oneEdit&lt;/strong&gt;: A lightweight online editor [side-effect, learn javascript]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tweetZilla&lt;/strong&gt;: with continuous deployment, the natural way of tracking
issues is to follow-up on feedback from users through tweets. parse
the tweets, cluster by issue[use k-means clustering] and follow-up
until they are fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="life-checklist"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Life checklist:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be organized&lt;/em&gt;: Need to stop missing the deadlines and schedules. Find
a tool to organize everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Less distraction&lt;/em&gt;: At any point of time, I have 15-20 chrome tabs open
in a window.[not to mention, multiple windows :-/]. I have an account
in every new social/tech/recommendation/news-feed site, with far less
interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overcome Analyses-Paralysis&lt;/em&gt;: Spend less time analyzing, more time
implementing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="personal-checklist"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Personal checklist:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pause more often: Stop rushing through life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speak more: Have to stop talking to the point.[this is futile]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop binge eating: The fact that I don't put on weight even after
destroying kilos of chocolates, doesn't mean I should abuse my
stomach and teeth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue not being an asshole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;First off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its been almost a semester since I started in Cornell and without a blogpost.
Which is unacceptable. Ergo the blog-gates will open.
I love bullets, hence instead of a paragraphs, there will be bullet points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly believe  that taking a break from work and studying for a year does
wonders to your energy levels. I can now work faster, better and more eager to
work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dabbled for a while about continuing in research and thought for a while..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-lure-of-academia"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The lure of Academia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contagious enthusiasm: You are surrounded by (mostly)enthusiastic bunch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work hard play hard lifestyle: No monotonicity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexible: With classes as rare as twice a week and as sparse as a sparse
matrix, you have all the freedom to be a night owl or an early bird.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general the work is much more interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-lure-of-corporate"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The lure of Corporate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sigh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Working in a Tech Startup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-experience"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in a startup is an experience in itself. By startups I mean
those working on lean budgets and crazy schedules, Where the
responsibility and trust employers put on people make them work as if
working for their own company. And no large company can motivate people
to that level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But its no easy going. You need to wear a shirt saying &amp;quot;I never log
out&amp;quot;. And thats how you will be working; without logging out. Because
when the world unwinds, you push code. [Notice how I trivialized
everything by saying &amp;quot;push code&amp;quot;]
Considering the time and effort required, its no wonder there is a long
list of young entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another aspect of working in an upcoming company which gets
shadowed by the term &amp;quot;startup&amp;quot;; cost effectiveness. Invariably most of
the small and upcoming companies are short of cash and resources. When
you decide to work there, you need to understand and respect the
shortage of resources and still be willing to work. For most[at least in
India] It will seem a ridiculous idea to work at a lesser salary and
still be happy about it. They probably won't matter because those aren't
the ones you want to have anyway. Nothing can replace true
interest/passion/willingness for technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-fun"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Fun&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh you will have fun there, and loads of it. People who hire you are
same as you are. Nerdy with a touch of Management. Most of the time they
will be your friends. You will spend long weekdays or even weekends with
them, And any appreciation or rebuke will be equally direct. And that is
good. You wouldn't want to work where recognition depends on your ass
kissing abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-effort"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Effort&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a lot to run a small company. I have seen my friend doing it,
and its incredibly hard. I cannot do it, at least not as of now. It
takes a lot of context switching, thick skin to handle customers, a
hyper active brain, and lots of perseverance. And thats why I have
immense respect for people who do it. And I like to be around such
people [1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="saving-the-penny"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Saving the Penny&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will learn to be frugal, getting creative with saving money whenever
you can. Working out of your home, friends home, barn, shed... you get
the idea, using public transport instead of your comfortable car, double
checking before you blow off money on a weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="living-as-a-student"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Living as a Student&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its exactly as working in a startup, [but you don't get paid as much :)
]. Thats why the transition from a startup to a student is a breeze.
Every point above holds true for a student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I am having such a good time&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; - Queen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1]: I worked for a year with the guys behind &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://nh7.in"&gt;NH7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;On a night like this&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a night like this, there are very few things which can go right.A
rick with a right indicator isn't one of them though.An alcohol induced
nerve cells tingling for the entire night might just be the thing.Even
otherwise its a money well spent. It made me feel happy.I can handle
driving when drunk(oh pliss), but i can't handle the randomness in my
head.Sometimes I feel as satisfied as a hippie and other times, total
weirdness. Assuming this weirdness isn't hangover, maybe this is how i
should be when I am sober.Lots o f weirdness in my head. And when i am
drunk ,there should just be peace-ness.If I have to get drunk to tickle
my nerve cells, My nerve cells must be fried beyond repair.More so the
reason to drink more and get most out of them while i still can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, how did I get to that conclusion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Life.. on a past lane&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years since I started working, Changed one company.. No enthusiasm
to change again. [Interesting work will be done on weekends rather than
in a stuffy software company.]
Memorable events&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visited Switzerland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visited Paris.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visited Italy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visited Amsterdam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visited Singapore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made an &amp;quot;international good friend&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went to the Highest Accessible Point in Europe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smoked a cigarette with a Korean friend at 00:00 AM on the street at
a freezing temperature of 0 Celsius with only a shirt and pyjama.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taught a Korean how to smoke in Indian Style&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tried all the Sea Foods(Octopus,Squid,small fish,Oyster..) before I
could digest what they were.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learnt to cook edible food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made some &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot;... lost some..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made new memories, to help fade out the old ones...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life gave too much.. I could have survived with less :) All thanks to a
&amp;quot;thing&amp;quot; called software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Death&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was 12.No where near a justifiable age to..die.Yet there he
was,taking his last whiffs of air ,his last views of this forsaken world
full of hopelessly confused-yet-which their confident faces
betrayed.They were feeling bad for him.I could see him almost felt like
laughing on that thought;if he could laugh that Is.Maybe he was happy to
go.I've seen him happy,sad excited.. even depressed.But never like
this.His bright and piercing eyes would reflect every damn emotion
without a fault.His eyes would shine forth with all Its honesty,with all
the expressions which words would never do justice.His face was Indeed
an Index of his mind.His face was a picture of Innocence.How many of us
can manage that?People would see him and envy their own lack of It.He
was gifted.Not this time.His was expressionless.There was a hint of
confusion,a hint of excitement on seeing me,but It was all buried under
a cloak of Indifference..as If It was not worth think about It.He was
just lying there and waiting for all this to end,so that he can be
normal again,play, eat, sleep.Did he know that things will never be the
same again?at least not for him..and at least not for me.I am not
strong.I realized It the moment I saw his eyes.I felt terribly weak.All
the emotions gathered(from not crying for 10yrs) and seemed ready to
explode right through my eyes.It was hopeless to try and stop
It.Hopeless to even think about control.For all this time I dreaded
seeing this sight.Never saw anyone dying...until now.But he was not just
anyone.He was my truest friend.He felt happy to see me..at least I
thought so.Trying desperately to control my outburst I came near
him.Hard to express what I felt.It was the saddest day of my &amp;quot;life&amp;quot;.It
was hopelessly unreal.It was draining me out.sapping my energy to the
last bit.Breaking down right In front of him,I dint care what he would
think.I was loosing a pound of flesh of myself(comparison Is all that I
can muster) and It bloody hurt like a broken bone.Then, he was just
motionless.His Innocent face was as If It was nailed to that
expression.Something In him was missing which made
him..alive.Something.Something I don't know,Something, about which I
dint care,Something, which betrayed his body and left,Something, which
made him...Tubby.It was not the Death of a person,It was the death of
that something.It was the Death of a Soul.Does It matter now that I am
now wishing that I were dead?Does It matter now that I cant manage to
forget his face?Does it matter now that I want him back again?Does one
life values more than the other?Does It matter that Tubby Is...a Dog?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wave nature of Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought for today...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
Some people's lives are like cosine (x) -- starts at 1 and then goes to
0. Other people's lives are like sine (x) -- starts at 0 and then goes
to 1. But when you take the integral from 0 to 2 pi, it comes out to 0
for everyone.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it really so? &amp;quot;Dont ask me,I dont know..&amp;quot; - Ozzy&lt;/p&gt;
