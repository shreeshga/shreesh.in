<h2>Working in a Tech Startup</h2>
<div class="section" id="the-experience">
<h3>The Experience</h3>
<p>Working in a startup is an experience in itself. By startups I mean
those working on lean budgets and crazy schedules, Where the
responsibility and trust employers put on people make them work as if
working for their own company. And no large company can motivate people
to that level.</p>
<p>But its no easy going. You need to wear a shirt saying &quot;I never log
out&quot;. And thats how you will be working; without logging out. Because
when the world unwinds, you push code. [Notice how I trivialized
everything by saying &quot;push code&quot;]
Considering the time and effort required, its no wonder there is a long
list of young entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>There is another aspect of working in an upcoming company which gets
shadowed by the term &quot;startup&quot;; cost effectiveness. Invariably most of
the small and upcoming companies are short of cash and resources. When
you decide to work there, you need to understand and respect the
shortage of resources and still be willing to work. For most[at least in
India] It will seem a ridiculous idea to work at a lesser salary and
still be happy about it. They probably won't matter because those aren't
the ones you want to have anyway. Nothing can replace true
interest/passion/willingness for technology.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-fun">
<h3>The Fun</h3>
<p>Oh you will have fun there, and loads of it. People who hire you are
same as you are. Nerdy with a touch of Management. Most of the time they
will be your friends. You will spend long weekdays or even weekends with
them, And any appreciation or rebuke will be equally direct. And that is
good. You wouldn't want to work where recognition depends on your ass
kissing abilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-effort">
<h3>The Effort</h3>
<p>It takes a lot to run a small company. I have seen my friend doing it,
and its incredibly hard. I cannot do it, at least not as of now. It
takes a lot of context switching, thick skin to handle customers, a
hyper active brain, and lots of perseverance. And thats why I have
immense respect for people who do it. And I like to be around such
people [1].</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="saving-the-penny">
<h3>Saving the Penny</h3>
<p>You will learn to be frugal, getting creative with saving money whenever
you can. Working out of your home, friends home, barn, shed... you get
the idea, using public transport instead of your comfortable car, double
checking before you blow off money on a weekend.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="living-as-a-student">
<h3>Living as a Student</h3>
<p>Its exactly as working in a startup, [but you don't get paid as much :)
]. Thats why the transition from a startup to a student is a breeze.
Every point above holds true for a student.</p>
