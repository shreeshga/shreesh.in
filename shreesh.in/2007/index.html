        <p>Slang : nai thara (Naa-Yee Tha-raaaa) (adj) Literal Meaning: Dog Like or
Like a Doggie or Mutt Like or Canine Like</p>
<p>Hindi Equavalent : Kutte ki tharah: Eg: Arrey yaaar,aaj tho Mysore Road
Kutte ki tharah Jam tha. Oh! Friend,Today the Mysore Road was jammed
like a Dog!</p>
<p>Synonyms(Slangs) : Sakkath,Super,Bombbat,ulti. Antonymns(Slangs) : Shaa
thara. Usage : something which demands a superlative qualification in a
good sense,</p>
<p>Instead of saying that something is 'amazing' or 'awesome'(which has
become overtly clich√àd BTW),this usage of 'nai thara' seems more
original but nevertheless ....umm... slum-like(explanation needed).</p>
<p>Examples: * macha, Aero-show mathra nai thara itthu lo! Buddy,Aero-show
was awesome(Dog like) man!</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Now, after all the hullabaloo over the 'unexpected loss ' of the Indian
cricket team in the ongoing world cup of paltry 12 countries,after
cursing the 11 blue upcoming Ad actors for their absence of ballz to
tame a cricket ball, after sympathizing with the coach for having to put
up with all flash-pan talents that form the cricket of a billion
people,and after deciding to hold a Hi-Level conferences to decide the
winner of the lot(who gets the esteemed title of HisBakraness) ,Its time
to be different and nominate a new bakra to take the blame.umm..make
that bakras...</p>
<p>Hurray!Its Us!</p>
<p>Yep we are the real culprits behind this colossal depression sweeping
the nation. Whats our crime?Our crime,ladies and ladas, is that we
believed..</p>
<p>Ever wondered why we believe in our 'awesome' cricket team so much so
that we cheer for their amazing fighting spirit while playing 'talented'
teams like Zimbabwe,bangladesh,kenya..or heck they would even make a
close match against a banana leaf-clad group of tribal people from
Andaman Why? because it their duty and responsibility to make the match
interesting for the scores of fanatics..ummm sorry fans back home and in
front...of the field, I meant.How bloody considerate of them.</p>
<p>Ever wondered why we cheer the team india even when they lose(close or
drubbing dosent matter) to the finger countable countries that play test
cricket?</p>
<p>Ever wondered why we always seem to believe in something that dosen't
exist? (In the case study of cricket..its the talent that doesn't exist)</p>
<p>So,ill repeat the question,lest i deviate from the point i wish to
make,however I would like to wander you off the flesh of the blog just
to prove how bloody amazingly talented i am at satire and what not.Here
I repeat,yet again, the question i was going to ask at the start of this
paragraph which is going on like a big-bubble chewing gum drawn out of
your mouth slowly after squeezing the juice out of it.And its getting
equally gross as well.</p>
<p>Finally here is the question: WHY THE HELL WE BELIEVE IN THE INDIAN
CRICKET TEAM TO WIN THE BLOODY WORLD CUP OF 12 COUNTRIES?</p>
<p>The flaw is in our part(no.Not that part) The part of us which has been
handed down to us from th time of our forefathers(who were not yet human
and a little monkey types).</p>
<p>The part of us which looks for a scapegoat to blame our failures,our
frustrations(not that type) and our KLPDs(not that..err. ok, that type
only) which is none other than our very own mysterious Mr God.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>We are taught to 'believe' in yourselves even if you are shit at
everything. We are taught to 'just give your best' and leave everything
to 'him'(pointing their forefinger to the sky,or to the mosquitoes
flying over your head..don't know which)</p>
<p>We are taught to 'just have some faith'(ala Hollywood movies with a hot
actress touching your hand with an inspirational background score.ha!
which moron doesn't want to have faith then?).</p>
<p>When the truth is -&gt; Nobody knows what the heck they are talking about.
Never seen a any angle flying over the Australian team when they beat
the crap out of the indians.Never seen any devil with a tail, poking at
the butts of our cricketrs when they fall hopelessly all over the tiny
cricket ball.</p>
<p>We all trying to build a real castle of our dreams with virtual pillars.</p>
<p>In short,We just have it in us,to just close our eyes and imagine a
super-hero and pray so bloody hard that,we get some air pumped into us
where there actually should be talent.</p>
<p>Now,show me the moron who says 'After all the preparation,you just need
to have some faith to win it' . Ill let loose him amidst some cricket
fans who are pissed in mega and giga litres of pee.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Don't believe in hot air,believe in facts,believe in
reality for chrissake!</p>
<p>PS:to be continued...but take a look at this link to grasp what i am
really getting at</p>

        <p>He was 12.No where near a justifiable age to..die.Yet there he
was,taking his last whiffs of air ,his last views of this forsaken world
full of hopelessly confused-yet-which their confident faces
betrayed.They were feeling bad for him.I could see him almost felt like
laughing on that thought;if he could laugh that Is.Maybe he was happy to
go.I've seen him happy,sad excited.. even depressed.But never like
this.His bright and piercing eyes would reflect every damn emotion
without a fault.His eyes would shine forth with all Its honesty,with all
the expressions which words would never do justice.His face was Indeed
an Index of his mind.His face was a picture of Innocence.How many of us
can manage that?People would see him and envy their own lack of It.He
was gifted.Not this time.His was expressionless.There was a hint of
confusion,a hint of excitement on seeing me,but It was all buried under
a cloak of Indifference..as If It was not worth think about It.He was
just lying there and waiting for all this to end,so that he can be
normal again,play, eat, sleep.Did he know that things will never be the
same again?at least not for him..and at least not for me.I am not
strong.I realized It the moment I saw his eyes.I felt terribly weak.All
the emotions gathered(from not crying for 10yrs) and seemed ready to
explode right through my eyes.It was hopeless to try and stop
It.Hopeless to even think about control.For all this time I dreaded
seeing this sight.Never saw anyone dying...until now.But he was not just
anyone.He was my truest friend.He felt happy to see me..at least I
thought so.Trying desperately to control my outburst I came near
him.Hard to express what I felt.It was the saddest day of my &quot;life&quot;.It
was hopelessly unreal.It was draining me out.sapping my energy to the
last bit.Breaking down right In front of him,I dint care what he would
think.I was loosing a pound of flesh of myself(comparison Is all that I
can muster) and It bloody hurt like a broken bone.Then, he was just
motionless.His Innocent face was as If It was nailed to that
expression.Something In him was missing which made
him..alive.Something.Something I don't know,Something, about which I
dint care,Something, which betrayed his body and left,Something, which
made him...Tubby.It was not the Death of a person,It was the death of
that something.It was the Death of a Soul.Does It matter now that I am
now wishing that I were dead?Does It matter now that I cant manage to
forget his face?Does it matter now that I want him back again?Does one
life values more than the other?Does It matter that Tubby Is...a Dog?</p>
