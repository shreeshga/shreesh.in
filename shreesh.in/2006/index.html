<dd>&quot;We'll follow terrorists everywhere. We will corner the bandits in the
toilet and wipe them out.If you are a Christian, you are in danger. Even
if you are an atheist, you are in danger, and if you decide to convert
to Islam, this will not save you, either, because traditional Islam is
inimical to the conditions and objectives set by the terrorists. If you
are prepared to become a most radical Islamist and are prepared to
circumcise yourself, I invite you to come to Moscow. I will recommend
having the operation done in such a way that nothing will grow for you
there anymore.&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<p>Putin snapping back at a reporter from Le Monde who asked a critical
question about the conduct of the war in Chechnya, in November 2002. The
quotation was rendered innocuous by his interpreter, but the original
was recorded on audio and widely reprinted in Russia.</p>
<p>He knows how to treat insurgents.No deal with the terrorists.Pure guts
to send troops to kill terrorists in beslan school hostage crises.no
prize for guessing what our government would have done.gift wrap a
ransom and parcel some hi-funda criminals for them and hold a victory
party.How can you negotitate with a terrorist?Only a spy knows the only
way you negotiate with a terrorist to point a gun at his and...pull the
trigger.But the question is,is he taking the aggressive stance so much
so as to kill all those who oppose him? However insignificant they might
be?</p>
<p>first <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/07/AR2006100700308.html">Anna Politkovskaya(shot
dead)</a>
now <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sweetness-light.com/archive/britain-says-putin-critic-died-of-radiation-poisoning">Litvinenko(poisoned by no less than
polonium-210).</a>
One was investigating rights violation in Chechen area by Russian forces
and the other was blaming the Russian govt of 1999 bombings in
Russia.And thats not all, 12 journalists have been killed in russia
since 2000!its the third most dangerous place on earth for journalists!</p>
<p>I don't think Putin would risk such high-profile killings in public just
to silence some constantly blabbering journalists(they might be right of
course!) that too when his popularity is high in Russia.</p>
<p>But Putin don't think has unlearned what he has learned at FSB,In his
own words...</p>
<blockquote>
On December 2005, Putin said to a group of FSB officers: _&quot;There is
no such thing as a former KGB man&quot;</blockquote>

        <p>As Feb 20th draws near,eMuzed remembers this day with a grimace. It was
this day,1 year ago, When it let in a moron-looking dude of semi-cooked
knowledge of Em-bedded Soft-ware (Soft bedded Emware??),with the josh of
10 Bulls(nulls?) with their tail bitten. But must say this one year went
like a cool breeze on a hot and sweaty Chennai afternoon.</p>
<p>Though eMuzed became whatitsname then finally to become
whatthefuckitsname,one aspect never changed: The human resource.And I
thoroughly enjoyed the company of a few lucky resources. And maybe ill
remember eMuzed for the people and then maybe about the work.</p>
<p>Here's a lsit of characters in the Doomed-to-flop movie called &quot;NULLa?&quot;
(pronounce like &quot;Malla&quot; with a N.Not to be confused with the Kannada
word Nalla (without the Question mark),because i don't know what it
means,better safe than sorry).</p>
<p><strong>Characters in order of Appearance</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Harish alias Harishah alias Harishaaaa alias ...(var args) :
Bored?mood out?Angry? All you need is a dose of Harish and you will
feel alive again. The mother...sorry father of all painkillers,He is
the man with a sheer talent of communication. Harish has a 80feet
highway running between his heart and Mouth.Clear as a see-through
glass and has been my perfect friend. As Open as Linux,as reliable as
Mac OS and as known about as Windows. My <a class="reference external" href="tip:never">tip:never</a> try to disprove
whatever he says however unbelievable he might try to sound, 9 out of
10,he will be right,sadly. Brainy guy who acts otherwise.</li>
<li>Sudhir alias Ski: Sky the person with a grunge-voice and fuck you(can
be literally,on demand) attitude. Sky has two weakness RC and DC.And
when they both mix,It rains DC,DC and some more DC. Sky the DON with
carom,TT, and DC.Is psychic about RD burman,and Spirituality,Has a
talent of playing around with words and a flair for &quot;RnD&quot;.Get a
feeling that he is the role model for his juniors(Poor souls).</li>
<li>Srinivas alias Seena alias Sheena: A seasoned athlete, who
specializes in the Triathlon event comprising Marathon
ramblings,Grueling(for the listeners that is) singing sessions and a
strenuous Kannada conversation;leave you gasping for breath.An
outright honest character, with an innocence that shines forth.Whats
on his heart, is in no time right out of his mouth and banging on the
listener's ear drums.Has a highly developed brain which he puts to
good use(occasionally to bug others,when he doesn't have to Debug).</li>
<li>A Hologram Sticker:</li>
<li>Vinod : The panta in every sense of the word.His major major talent:
eagerness to help others(Read ME). Saved my ballz when I had them in
a grinding machine. Someday he will grow over pinkfloyd.</li>
<li>RS: A PYT with brain.Wherever she goes,'Man'kind follows.</li>
</ul>
<p>And two other certain PYTs whom I dare not approach coz of regular
outbreak of wheezing cough among male colleagues,whenever I reach their
vicinity.An interesting challenge for the Medical faculty to do their
&quot;RnD&quot; on.</p>
<p>Won't forget in a hurry the carrom matches,the walk on JB nagar main
road to eat chaats,the senseless talk,&quot;oil&quot; sessions in ski's house,the
AC-less,water-less facility that was B3,and of course a little of what I
did in office...work.</p>

<dd>&quot;This is the day that you will ALWAYS remember as the day that you...
almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<p>There,I've quoted it for the last time before it becomes a terrible
bore.Captain Jack Sparrow is quite a character, and a character he must
be to hold the Pirates... movie together, on his own.</p>
<p>The second part is all about Jack.Jack the Cunning,Jack the Wily,Jack
the Captain,Jack the Coward,Jack the Hero, Jack the Bi(??) and of course
Jack the Pirate.People want to see him(I am no different) and thank god
he did not disappoint. All hail Johhny Depp!</p>
<p>Apparently, people like Jack Sparrow,irrespective of how much ever
absurd the scene might be, Jack stands out.His character is a mix of
self contradicting qualities: cowardly brave, gay-ishly straight,
cunningly naive, seriously funny but <em>good</em> nonetheless. (Apparently
being good is vital for one to be likeable). Maybe Jack will become the
new definition of Commercial Hero. Personally I think his character was
screwed up by making him &quot;generous&quot; and &quot;brave&quot;. Jack Sparrow was a born
winner and the secret was that, he wasn't your regular
baddie-bashing-Hero When he wants to save his ass, he doesn't damn who
gets hurt or killed. He can be a coward when he wants to,a loser when he
wants to or even a killer.. if he wants to. I would have loved to see
him just walk away without a glance when the Kraken attacks the ship,
instead of returning to the ship.</p>
<p>All the noble deeds should have been left to Mr.Turner, That at least
would have put some meat into his character.</p>

        <p>I can almost imagine myself,sitting in the back seat of a mini bus with
a big fat book, straining my eyes on the pathetic font of a gripping
novel and bumping around on the &quot;asphalt&quot; roads of Bangalore.</p>
<p>I need not hurry for I have got all the time in the world, till I reach
my home.It's been, after all just 2 hours since I left my office(which
is BTW located in a far-off(not distance-wise, time-wise) place called
Marathalli).And we have yet to come out of our campus gates. I can even
finish a thesis on the book and get a PhD as well, which is only limited
by my vacuum filled brain, the proof of which lies in the fact that, I
ended up in this state of day schedule 4hrs-journey
9hrs(hopefully)-journey 8hrs- sleep. Come 17th and for me it will all
become a reality.The same old routine of getting early,only to find out
that it was not early enough,again. Pathetically running to the bus stop
to catch the last hope of reaching office,alive before I have to turn
the BMTC buses. The same old zombie feeling in the morning, and by the
time you feel alive..get ready for the trek back home. I don't have any
inclination to work in a &quot;swanky&quot; building, and that too after a 2hr
drive?no than ks. What do you get in that High-5 building?a puny 3x3
plastic box-open on 3 sides, called a cubicle? My father has had a
separate room since he was 19.And I am still stuck with this <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">`</span></a>sick
cube &lt;<a class="reference external" href="http://slashdot.org/articles/06/03/09/1943243.shtml">http://slashdot.org/articles/06/03/09/1943243.shtml</a>&gt;`_(read the
link if you empathize with me on this regard) Where me,my chair and my
comp fight for every inch of space available.Not to speak of the
&quot;privacy&quot; that comes free with a 4 cubicle piece.I could dwell on that
thing on for pages together,but that is so goddamn pointless .Cubes cut
costs for the Company..and you know what that means. I would give an arm
and a tooth for an office near to where I live.</p>

<p>Why cant we have a decentralized working system?Instead of all the
employees flocking at a single place,let the different team(who BTW
serve no purpose working at a single location because they rarely
interact) be located a different places which are convenient to all the
team members,Data exchange should not be a problem. So why herd everyone
at those huge buildings?To show off? that we-the-company have more
money-money so please customers come-come?sic. But what the heck, as
usual I end up compromising. But no one and absolutely NO ONE is gonna
stop me from cribbing about it.</p>
<p>So there.</p>
