        <p>Turns out; I am getting married. So, I wanted to create a web site instead of
mailing everyone with a Megabytes of scanned invitation [I know, not very Indian of me].</p>
<p>Being a  programmer, using e-wedding or such other hosting sites is wholly
<em>unacceptable</em>.</p>
<p>I had worked with Python Flask before, so I quickly put together a static site
using the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mbr/flask-bootstrap">Flask-Bootstrap-Responsive</a> plugin [see? How easily I  put together
a site with best of the breed] and threw it in my AWS micro instance.</p>
<p>I had the idea of creating a joint-timeline of Prerna &amp; me, with special
moments along with some pictures. Turns out Facebook has the feature in &quot;See
Friendship&quot; [who knew?]. I found an awesome js library <a class="reference external" href="http://timeline.verite.co/">TimelineJS</a> which reads data from  published Google
spreadsheet, parses the data and displays a nice timeline of events.</p>
<p>So, We both started filling in the event details in a shared Google drive <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AtNxSwigiymodHR5ZEFnOUN0T3ZhUWJNRWEzTXFJemc&amp;single=true&amp;gid=0&amp;output=html">Spreadsheet</a>.
I, for the most part, edited the sheet from the Android Google <em>Drive App</em>.</p>
<p>I wanted to have a message board to get people to leave  a message.
[I hate the guest book feature which is essentially a text box and submit
button] Sadly, Google+ does not yet support a writable comment box plugin.
So, went with the least desirable FB comment box.</p>
<p>TL;DR: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unkIVvjZc9Y">HDFU</a> and write your own
wedding site.</p>
<p>Also, <a class="reference external" href="http://prerna.shreesh.in">Wedding!</a></p>

        <p>There are a lot of guidelines of what constitutes good code; fewer bugs, easier
to understand and so on. But they are too vague to describe.
For me, If I had to define good code specifically</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Any code which I can fix</strong></blockquote>
<p>And consequently, any code which makes it harder for me to fix is bad.
For Example, the point of modular programming is to define functions which
can be described by their name. So that when you are reading code with folding
enabled, you don't have to read through to each function to guess what its
doing. Some programmers code like this</p>
<pre class="code java literal-block">
<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">onethingFunc</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">doSomething</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="n">doSomethingElse</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="n">doSomeOtherThing</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="n">andOn</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="n">andOn</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">This code reminds me of assembly instructions.</div>
<div class="line">One instruction per line.</div>
<div class="line">Very hard to read.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Instead, if the above code  was something like this:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<pre class="code java literal-block">
<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">doSomething</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">do</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="n">some</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="n">thing</span><span class="o">;</span>

        <p>I was looking forward to <em>The Android App Clinic: Travel Booking and Planning</em>
[<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=k1_8N-KToPs#t=2306s">link</a>] by Reto Meier &amp; Ian Ni-Lewis. I even put in a little unnamed comment
and a thumbs up for KAYAK.
[Notice the lowercase 'I'].</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;i work for kayak and would love some feedback.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>Although it was a good third-perspective, It had some problems:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Too much focus on  Android UI Design guideline.</li>
<li>Considering they review many many apps, seemingly common repetitive UI
patterns start to annoy them [Like the &quot;Rate Me Rate Me!!&quot; dialog]</li>
<li>A very cursory review, overlooking the content and just focusing on the
presentation.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They followed it up with a redesign of the KAYAK [and other apps] so that its
more consistent with the Android UI pattern[<a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/live/shows/ahNzfmdvb2dsZS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzcg4LEgVFdmVudBjT3pMEDA/">design_link</a>].</p>
<p>But what struck me most, was their absolute focus on enforcing the Android UI
patterns among all the apps. Which isn't surprising since the overall Android
experience is their <strong>Product</strong>. And they were right in being particular about
it.</p>
<p>The problem is that, the companies building those apps want to promote
<em>their</em> product and want to have a consistent experience across devices.</p>
<p>Hence, the priorities of consumer-facing companies and device platform creators are
orthogonal.</p>
<p>But when I start to use the apps as normal user, I can 'decipher' most of the
UI elements and for the most part don't care if an app misses the ActionBar
pattern.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I am obsessed with my product[my time], and until the apps don't waste it.</div>
<div class="line">I would live with a gradient header with a center text.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">PS: As an android fan, I would love to see all the apps having the same  Android UI pattern.</div>

</blockquote>
<p>I heavily use Google products irrespective of the mobile, which makes me
believe that  Google clearly has a better business model.
Even though I have never clicked on google ads in GMail nor in search results,yet
Google had over $37 billion in revenue[2011] [<a class="reference external" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/48369286/ns/business-motley_fool/#.UCMsTmNAYUo">msnbc</a>], proving there <em>is</em> some value in text ads afterall.</p>
<p>But, just the revenue of Apple from iPhone  was $50 billion.</p>
<p>Even though Google's business model is <em>making smart algorithms to make people click
ads</em>, It is still in better position than Apple's presence in mobile device
market. Samsung is catching up fast and people seem to forget how fast market leaders
are destroyed[RIM, Nokia].</p>
<p>Google on the other hand, does not have a serious competitor in the ads business and
its safe to assume that it is going to be the leader for a few more years to
come.[And hopefully to be the first to hit upon an alternative  business model].</p>
<p>The sheer awesomeness of Google Knowledge graph, Android platform,ROS support,Google Maps,Optic network Self-driven cars has beaten out the Apple fan boy in me.</p>

<blockquote>
Times of close approach are called ”launch windows” in the spaceflight vernacular.
Even though Mars doesn’t always come close enough for clear visual observation, navigators have an opportunity to launch a spacecraft to Mars every 26 months. Spaceships don’t just take off in any direction.
Escaping Earth’s gravitational pull requires a tremendous amount of energy. Even with that energy a spacecraft would never reach the orbit of Mars without a little help from its friends. To get a spacecraft to Mars, navigators time the launch so the spacecraft reaches Mars when it is on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth in order to take advantage of solar gravity.
The Sun’s gravitational pull will cause a spacecraft to “fall” toward the Sun. This motion follows predictable physical laws. These trajectories and orbits are collectively referred to as Hohmann transfer orbits. ”What you want to do is launch the spacecraft so it goes around the Sun to meet Mars,” says Moriba Jah at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a navigator on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, We give it the least amount of energy possible and let the Sun’s gravity do as much as it can for us. As a result the spacecraft comes up on Mars from behind, but instead of sailing past, a short blast from the boosters allow it to slow down and be captured into orbit by Mars’ gravity. The trip takes about 214 days.</blockquote>

<p>Well, Thats a bummer. No wonder NASA isn't getting any funding.</p>
<p>People should  stop making such depressing posts. Some people like me, have lived
life thinking some time in the future, we might drop a visit to the far end of the universe and have a cup of coffee with aliens. Such news need to be put in spoiler alerts.</p>
<p>In other news, That boson which was observed, might <em>might</em> just be the Higgs boson.
If its not the higgs boson, I want my hours of &quot;Higg's boson goggling&quot; back.
The only real aspiration in my life was to understand the world
we are in. Since the news of the boson, I try to imagine every thing in

    <div class="content">
        <p>Cornell is a <strong>great</strong> place to study. Having worked for quite sometime, I can
better appreciate and analyse the whole experience of academia.</p>
<p>Based on my semester worth of experience here are my two cents on surviving the
course.</p>
<div class="section" id="about-ithaca">
<h1>About Ithaca</h1>
<p>Its beautiful in summer and white as Gandalf during winters.</p>
<p><em>Collegetown</em> is a hub of activity and most certainly the place to be on a Friday
night. There are quite a few pubs, so getting drunk and studying should be
possible on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>There are beautiful parks,lakes,gorges and falls which should not be missed.
PS: The airport is no bigger than a dining hall and the planes are small bombardier aircrafts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="selecting-courses">
<h1>Selecting courses</h1>
<p>You need to complete 30 credits in two semesters.</p>
<p>There are two tracks: Systems and Machine Learning.</p>
<p>Systems courses are related to OS, Database and compilers.
Machine Learning courses deal with Machine learning algorithms, Data Analysis and Robotics.
Although you can take any courses, its best if you stick one track and pick courses in depth.</p>
<p>My advice is to add all the courses you are interested(max 22 credits) and
attend the classes for a few days. Drop the ones which don't interest you or
which seem too difficult to handle.</p>
<p>My picks for Fall:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Machine Learning : Course content is very interesting and Prof. Joachims is well known  for his work on <em>SVM</em></li>
<li>Operating Systems Practicum: You will build an entire OS complete with
scheduler,Networking and IPC.</li>
<li>Information Retrieval: Prof. Ginsparg is very famous for his work on <a class="reference external" href="http://arxiv.org">arxiv</a></li>
<li>Database Systems: The course goes in-depth into SQL queries and optimization.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="managing-course-work">
<h1>Managing course work</h1>
<p><strong>Clarify doubts about assignments and start working as soon as they are posted</strong></p>
<p>I can't stress this enough. Failure to do so will ruin you of your whatever
life you might have on your weekends.</p>
<p>Do not take more than 14 credits (for an average person). Try to pick courses
which have assigments and project work in groups rather than alone.
The examinations here stress more about application of a concept than mere
verbatim textbook content.</p>
<p>Make time on Thursdays and Saturdays and play <em>ping-pong</em> or any other sport at
Helen Newman Hall</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="placements">
<h1>Placements</h1>
<p>Cornell career center is pretty amazing in attracting all the top companies for
its career fair. Make sure you prepare for the interview by practising  dynamic
programming code, efficient sorting/searching code, algorithm complexity and
some design questions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="winter-break">
<h1>Winter break</h1>
<p>Don't stay in Ithaca between Christmas and New year. It will be a ghost town.
Make some travel plans, or better, try for some winter internships.</p>
