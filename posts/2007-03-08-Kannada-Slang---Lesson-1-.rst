Kannada Slang - Lesson 1 
----------------------------------

Slang : nai thara (Naa-Yee Tha-raaaa) (adj) Literal Meaning: Dog Like or
Like a Doggie or Mutt Like or Canine Like

Hindi Equavalent : Kutte ki tharah: Eg: Arrey yaaar,aaj tho Mysore Road
Kutte ki tharah Jam tha. Oh! Friend,Today the Mysore Road was jammed
like a Dog!

Synonyms(Slangs) : Sakkath,Super,Bombbat,ulti. Antonymns(Slangs) : Shaa
thara. Usage : something which demands a superlative qualification in a
good sense,

Instead of saying that something is 'amazing' or 'awesome'(which has
become overtly clich√àd BTW),this usage of 'nai thara' seems more
original but nevertheless ....umm... slum-like(explanation needed).

Examples: \* macha, Aero-show mathra nai thara itthu lo! Buddy,Aero-show
was awesome(Dog like) man!

-  Ivattanthu naanu nai thara enjoy maadide. Today,i enjoyed like a
   dog(umm.???). shreesh shreesh.ayachit@gmail.com
