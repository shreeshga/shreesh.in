Here's to Human Curiosity
==========================

    Times of close approach are called ”launch windows” in the spaceflight vernacular. 
    Even though Mars doesn’t always come close enough for clear visual observation, navigators have an opportunity to launch a spacecraft to Mars every 26 months. Spaceships don’t just take off in any direction.
    Escaping Earth’s gravitational pull requires a tremendous amount of energy. Even with that energy a spacecraft would never reach the orbit of Mars without a little help from its friends. To get a spacecraft to Mars, navigators time the launch so the spacecraft reaches Mars when it is on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth in order to take advantage of solar gravity.
    The Sun’s gravitational pull will cause a spacecraft to “fall” toward the Sun. This motion follows predictable physical laws. These trajectories and orbits are collectively referred to as Hohmann transfer orbits. ”What you want to do is launch the spacecraft so it goes around the Sun to meet Mars,” says Moriba Jah at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a navigator on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, We give it the least amount of energy possible and let the Sun’s gravity do as much as it can for us. As a result the spacecraft comes up on Mars from behind, but instead of sailing past, a short blast from the boosters allow it to slow down and be captured into orbit by Mars’ gravity. The trip takes about 214 days.
