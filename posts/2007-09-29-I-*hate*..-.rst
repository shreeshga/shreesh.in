I hate Sare Gamma Delta Theta..whatever. I hate the way the anchors put
up a sugary face. I hate it when they *heavily* commercialize the
sets,the theme.. on second thoughts... It is a goddamn soap.

I hate when the participants say "thank You" hundred times over to the
"gurus"... I bet they actually mean.. "Fuck You guys,fuck you very very
much"

I hate that Himesh "mad as a Hatter" Reshamiya.

I hate when the singers plead and beg us to vote for them.feel like
sending them a 1Rupee coin.

Pathetic I say!pathetic.

I hate when they call on judges who put on a headphone and pretend to
'analyse' their voice...I bet the headphone is not even connected.

I hate...umm... GAAAA.Somebody stop me!

PS:Oh and i love the new AXE ad :)
