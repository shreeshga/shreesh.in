Etc Term Connotation (etc) :D 
----------------------------------


Pardon the inherent PJ that is the topic of this post. But as usual,that
is not the issue.

A damn funny discussion is going on
`here <http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/03/03/028258&from=rss>`_
about what does "etc" stand for in /etc(*No* further explanation) . I
vote for "et cetera", but that misses the point entirely. The FUN
point,that is.

The top `Backronymns <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym>`_ is : \*
Editable Text Configuration Stallman ishtlye(Left Recursive): \* Etc
Text Configuration. etc(don't pardon the pun) : \* Extended tool chest
\* Enormous Trove of Configuration files \* But some smart Aleck spoiled
all the fun:

And, as another user pointed out > "editable text configurations" is a
stupid name too, because if it's text, it's evidently editable. So why
not just "text configurations" then? Also, in early Unix, everything was
editable (remember,in Unix, everything is a file), so that's superfluous
too. And, lastly, it was the repository for a lot of things that weren't
configurations, including binaries.

Again, this is a backronym, and not even a clever one. Taking a cue from
"Editable Text Configuration", The below list was created. Keep your
floors clean,coz you may have to ROFL..

::
    emacs - Escape Meta Alt Control Shift. gdb - Get Down Baby. (ROFL^n)
    gcc - Give Communism (a) Chance. linux - Linus Is Not Usually
    Xeroflulogitic. lisp - Lisp Is (for) Symbolic Programming. java -
    Just Another Variant (of) Ada.
    perl - Perl Essentially Resembles Lisp.
    printf - People Rarely Insist (on) Naming This Function.
    sed - Slashdot (is) Easily Duped.
    top - Totally Ongoing Programs.
    vi - Very Irritating.


...Or maybe not.Ok,These are funny UNIX commands you can try.
::

    #make babies Don't know how to make babies
    #make sense can't make sense

If there is a virus on your system >#virus virus: not found.

::

    # man woman No manual entry for woman

Still dont see the humour? OK,now you can go to hell.
