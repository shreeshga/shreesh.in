A movie scene
----------------------------------


I have always been a fan of movies/Tv series starring Pankaj kapoor,the
earliest of which I didn't even remember the name.It was a story of
doctor,struggling to pursue his passion of finding a cure. His days
spent toiling away in his makeshift lab,amidst a strained family life
and a convoluted professional environment.I can neither recall the
plot,nor th actress nor the director.But I still vividly remember the
bearded face of the doctor with weary eyes, searching for an elusive
horizon.The strain of a man pulled in many different directions.I do
remember the scene, where his wife picks up his dairy from the table,
and reads two 2 short lines scribbled at the end of a page filled with
notes.Which summarizes the thoughts of the character:

    So much to do, So little is done

PS:The name of the movie I later found out was `Ek Doctor ki
Maut <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ek_Doctor_Ki_Maut>`_
