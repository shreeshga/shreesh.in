The Shining 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


    `Stanley Kubrick <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000040/>`_, known for
    his compulsiveness and numerous retakes, got the difficult shot of
    blood pouring from the elevators in only three takes. This would be
    remarkable if it weren't for the fact that the shot took nine days
    to set up; every time the doors opened and the blood poured out,
    Kubrick would say, "It doesn't look like blood." They had tried
    shooting that scene for an entire year.

    `Stanley Kubrick <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000040/>`_ demanded
    127 takes from†`Shelley
    Duvall <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001167/>`_ in one scene.

    According to†`Stephen King <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000175/>`_,
    the title is inspired by the refrain in the Plastic Ono Band's song,
    "Instant Karma" (by†`John
    Lennon <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006168/>`_), which features the
    chorus: "We all shine on."

    For the scene in which Jack breaks down the bathroom door, the props
    department built a door that could be easily broken. However,†`Jack
    Nicholson <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000197/>`_ worked as a
    volunteer fire marshal and tore it apart easily. The props
    department were then forced to build a stronger door.

    Steadicam operator†`Garrett
    Brown <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0113593/>`_ accomplished many of
    the ultra-low tracking corridor sequences from a wheelchair on which
    his invention was mounted. Grips would either pull backward or push
    forward the wheelchair, depending on the requirement of the shot

Just thought i would post some trivia on my†favorite†horror movie of all
time.
