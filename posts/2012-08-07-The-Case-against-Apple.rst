Google > Apple
===============

A normal day interaction with my mobile:[iPhone or Android]

    - Check GMail.
    - Check Weather.
    - Use Google maps
    - Browse Twitter,Zite.
    - Read a pdf file.
    - Open up saved documents, pages on *Evernote*.
    - Play an occasional game.
    - *Development mode*
    - Google for things which I have heard for first time.
    - Check time throughout the day.

I heavily use Google products irrespective of the mobile, which makes me
believe that  Google clearly has a better business model. 
Even though I have never clicked on google ads in GMail nor in search results,yet
Google had over $37 billion in revenue[2011] [msnbc_], proving there *is* some value in text ads afterall.

But, just the revenue of Apple from iPhone  was $50 billion.

Even though Google's business model is *making smart algorithms to make people click
ads*, It is still in better position than Apple's presence in mobile device
market. Samsung is catching up fast and people seem to forget how fast market leaders
are destroyed[RIM, Nokia]. 

Google on the other hand, does not have a serious competitor in the ads business and
its safe to assume that it is going to be the leader for a few more years to
come.[And hopefully to be the first to hit upon an alternative  business model].


The sheer awesomeness of Google Knowledge graph, Android platform,ROS support,Google Maps,Optic network Self-driven cars has beaten out the Apple fan boy in me.
