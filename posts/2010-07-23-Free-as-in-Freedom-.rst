Free as in Freedom 
----------------------------------

Today I am relieved; both from my company *and* from dated development
jobs.
After I witnessed a massive fuck-up of a major project by the management
team, I finally moved out of the company, and other similar companies. I
would never want to work in those companies where poor management
decisions overrule any good technical work, where engineers are horded
instead of valued.

I am going to work for very small company where passion for tech drives
the employees. Where each member would have the absolute freedom to work
from wherever they please as long as they are productive. Where there
would be no bar on sites which you can visit. Where you just don't work,
but learn everyday as you work;
